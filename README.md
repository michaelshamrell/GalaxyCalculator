#  Test Driven Development and Environments with JavaScript

Created by: *Michael Shamrell*

This project showcases my ability to create and use classes in javascript, and use jest testing to test my code.

# Technologies Used:
Git, Github, HTML, CSS, markdown, javasScript, jQuery, Jest, NPM, .gitignore, eslint, webpack, and bootstrap. 
# Application setup:
clone to git by clicking the green "Code" button on https://github.com/michaelshamrell/GalaxyCalculator
copy the link inside, then go into gitbash and do the command: $git clone (instert url here that you copied). Make sure you create a css and js file,  with bootstrap in css and jQuery in js. After this you are able to access the code by cding into the correct repository and typing code .
